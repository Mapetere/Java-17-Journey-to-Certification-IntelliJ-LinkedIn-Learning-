- ✅ Classes
- ✅ Main method
- ✅ Reserved words

## 📝 Key Concepts

### Packages
- Packages organize related classes into namespaces
- Declared with `package` keyword at top of file
- Convention: reverse domain name (e.g., `com.company.project`)
- Prevents naming conflicts between classes

### Classes
- Blueprint for creating objects
- Every Java file must contain at least one class
- Class name must match the filename (case-sensitive)
- Defined with `class` keyword

### Main Method
- Entry point of any Java application
- Signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`
- Must be exactly this signature for JVM to recognize it
- Only method that runs automatically when program starts

### Reserved Words (Keywords)
- Words reserved by Java that cannot be used as identifiers
- Examples: `class`, `public`, `static`, `void`, `int`, `if`, `else`, `return`
- Total of 50+ reserved words in Java
